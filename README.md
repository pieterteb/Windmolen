A chess engine written in C. Currently, Windmolen is in a usable state, but the engine does not know about draws other than stalemate and some UCI features are not implemented yet. The bare minimum is available though.

Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pieterteb/Windmolen.git
cd Windmolen/src
make
./windmolen
```
