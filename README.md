Currently, Windmolen is a completely functional UCI chess engine (no Chess960 support) written in C. It uses only the bare minimum of chess engine techniques: negamax search and pure material evaluation.

Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pieterteb/Windmolen.git
cd Windmolen/src
make
./windmolen
```
